// CI
- Anytime if someone is pushing code to a repo we should check if all the tests are passing
- Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, usually multiple times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and automated tests.
- This practice helps detect errors quickly, improves code quality, and reduces the integration problems that typically occur when merging multiple development branches.


// CD
- Continuous Deployment (CD), as the name suggests, involves continuously deploying your code to various environments, such as development, staging, and production. 
- CD ensures that the code changes are automatically deployed to the target environment once they pass the CI process, reducing manual intervention and streamlining the deployment process.


// Creating CI/CD for the repo: https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-18-2-ci-cd
- Fork and then clone the repo
  git clone <https://github.com/your-username/week-18-2-ci-cd.git>

- Install dependencies 
  cd week-18-2-ci-cd
  RUN: npm install

- Generate Prisma client
  cd packages/db
  npx prisma generate

- Build the project to check if it is building properly
  RUN: npm run build

- Creating a pipeling
  Create a folder .github/worflows/filename.yml in the root of your project folder
