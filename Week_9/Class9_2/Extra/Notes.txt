// Enums
Enums (short for enumerations) in TypeScript are a feature that allows us to define a set of named constants.
The concept behind an enumeration is to create a human-readable way to represent a set of constant values, which might otherwise be represented as numbers or strings.


// Generics
Generics enable you to create components that work with any data type while still providing compile-time type safety.


// Exporting and importing modules
TypeScript follows the ES6 module system, using import and export statements to share code between different files.
